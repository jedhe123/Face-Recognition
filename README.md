# Project Title = Face Recognition Project #
A face recognition system detects and identifies faces using computer vision and machine learning techniques. It captures facial features from images or video streams and matches them against a stored database to verify or recognize individuals. 

# Technologies Used #
1.Python

2.NumPy, Pandas

3.Sklearn dataset

# Features #

1.Face detection and recognition

2.Real-time processing using a webcam 

3.Support for multiple faces

4.User-friendly interface

5.Database for storing recognized faces

6.High accuracy using deep learning models

# Installation #

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python (>=3.7) installed.

Steps to Install

1.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/face-recognition.git
cd face-recognition

2.Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the face recognition script:

python face_recognition.py

# Usage #

1.Add Faces: use a prebuild dataset for sklearn dataset.

2.Train the Model: Run train.py to encode faces and store them.

3.Run Recognition: Start face_recognition.py to detect and recognize faces in real-time.

# Configuration #

Modify config.json for custom settings like:

1.model accuracy changes

2.Realtime face recognition

3.detect faces in images
